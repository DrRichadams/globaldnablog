# DNA and Immigration: Proving Biological Relationships Across Borders

In global migration cases, DNA testing often becomes the most reliable way to prove family relationships.

## When is DNA Testing Required?

Immigration authorities may request DNA evidence when:
- Birth certificates are missing or disputed
- Adoption or guardianship is being formalized
- A sponsor needs to prove biological kinship

## Legal Considerations
- Must be conducted by an accredited lab
- Chain-of-custody procedures must be followed
- Results must be sent directly to the requesting embassy or agency

## How It Helps
- Confirms family links
- Speeds up visa approvals
- Reduces fraudulent claims

**Tip:**  
Always follow the embassyâ€™s specific instructions to avoid delays or rejection.

**Bottom Line:**  
DNA testing is a powerful tool for keeping families together in legal and ethical immigration processes.
